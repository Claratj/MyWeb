                        <p>Based in Madrid, I'm focused on mainly Front-end but Back-end technologies too.</p>
                        <p>I don't know if I found coding or coding found me. I started my career in Graphic Design but I soon realised that the new platforms were not going to be in ink and paper.
                        I found in Web Development a field of infinite possibilities where the technical base is complemented with creativity and good practices.</p>
                        <p>My previous experience has been very useful tool when approaching any project, since I take into account the technical approach to development together with the user experience point of view.</p>
